# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

- **Version Control**: Use feature branches and meaningful commit messages
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines
- **Documentation**: Keep all project documentation updated
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages
| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters (location, price, amenities) |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Complete property details with images, description, amenities, reviews, and booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined payment process with booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### Color Styles
- Primary: #FF5A5F
- Secondary: #008489
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text: #222222
- Secondary Text: #717171

#### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
- **Headings**: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
- **Secondary Text**: Circular, Book (400), 14px

#### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying consistent design properties (colors, typography, spacing) ensures visual coherence across all application components. This maintains brand identity, improves user recognition, enables efficient collaboration between designers and developers, and ensures responsive behavior across devices. Documenting these properties prevents design inconsistencies and accelerates UI development.
