### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly interface is critical for booking platforms as it directly impacts conversion rates and customer retention. Intuitive navigation reduces friction during property discovery, while a streamlined checkout minimizes abandonment. Clear visual hierarchy and responsive design ensure accessibility across devices, fostering trust and encouraging repeat usage. Poor UX can lead to lost revenue, whereas optimized flows enhance user satisfaction and competitive advantage.
